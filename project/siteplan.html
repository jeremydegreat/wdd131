            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>The site or domain name (along with a logo) is the primary identifier and is critical for branding, visibility, and recognition. Securing a domain name that is available to purchase is normally important but not required in this class. You will need to provide a valid site name relevant to your project, along with a short description of why you chose it.</p>
